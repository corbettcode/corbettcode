I have a rich and extensive programming background spanning decades, giving me a unique perspective on the evolution of technology. Here's a concise overview of my experience:

## Programming Experience Overview

### Early Expertise (1970s):

Started with machine language and assembly, working close to the hardware.
Built a foundational understanding of low-level programming and system internals.

### Expanding Proficiency (1980sâ€“1990s):

Transitioned to C and C++, adopting structured and object-oriented programming paradigms.
Developed robust systems, applications, and performance-critical software.

### Modern Era (2000sâ€“Present):

Proficient in Java, contributing to cross-platform solutions, enterprise applications, and Android development.
Embraced Kotlin, exploring its concise syntax, functional programming features, and compatibility with existing Java ecosystems.
Kotlin Multiplatform Exploration:

Currently focusing on Kotlin Multiplatform, with a project centered around The Movie Database (TMDb).
Engaged in developing a cross-platform application with shared logic and platform-specific customizations.
